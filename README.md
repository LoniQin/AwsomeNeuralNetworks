This Project includes many interesting stuff of deep learning projects:

* [fashion_mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/LoniQin/AwsomeNeuralNetworks/blob/master/samples/fashion_mnist/fashion_mnist.ipynb) shows how to create a mnist classifier.
* [house_price_preditor.py](https://github.com/LoniQin/AwsomeNeuralNetworks/blob/master/samples/house_price/house_price_preditor.py) shows how to train house price data by using k-fold algorithm.
* [samples/fashion_mnist](https://github.com/LoniQin/AwsomeNeuralNetworks/tree/master/samples/fashion_mnist) shows different ways to create a mnist trainer such as LENET, AlexNET, NiN, VGG, GoogleLENET.
