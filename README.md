This Project includes many demos about creating a deep learning project.

* [LinearRegressionSimpleWay.py](https://github.com/LoniQin/DiveDeepIntoDeepLearning/blob/master/3.3%20LInearRegressionSimpleWay.py) shows the common process of training using random generated data.
* [fashion_mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/LoniQin/DiveDeepIntoDeepLearning/blob/master/fashion_mnist.ipynb) shows how to create a mnist classifier.
