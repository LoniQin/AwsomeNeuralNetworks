This Project includes many demos about creating a deep learning project.

* [In this sample](https://github.com/LoniQin/DiveDeepIntoDeepLearning/blob/master/3.3%20LInearRegressionSimpleWay.py), the shape of input data is (1000, 2), the shape of weight data is (2, 1), the shape of bias data is (1, 1), and the shape of labels is (1000,1). We generate random input data and use $y = Xw + b$ to generate y data, then we demonstrate the common training process and get the very near weight and bias answer within 10 epochs.
